### What I learned

I think the most I took from doing this QR Code challenge has probably been the use of CSS to shape it. Since I am fairly new to HTML and CSS in general it has been nice to be able to work on and use some things I haven't used before such as box-shadow and really uploading all of this to GitHub. I am still trying to remember the basic commands to upload everything to Github. All of this is good practice. I think styling it in CSS has also been a challenge, trying to remember how exactly to move what I want to place said item( in this case in the center). This challenge made me realize that I have a long way to go to be in the spot I want to be.



### Continued development

I am going to continue doing side projects through frontend mentor as I really enjoyed this project. I am also going to be doing my own t-shirt website and will be trying to do it through react.js. Hoping to add a bunch of projects to my e-portfolio that I have also created. 


### Useful resources
Using https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp has helped me alot to either reassure me that I am typing/using the correct things to style and if I didn't know how to style it. I found box-shadowing on here and used that as a guide.


## Final Words

This has been eye opening to me and seeing where I stand even though I know it is a simple project of a QR code. I have a long way to go and im excited to continue doing projects and seeing my progression. If you are reading this and would like to make any suggestions or feedback.
